# SDG Goals: A Causal Study
A Causal Study on SDG goals and Economic Indicators of developed vs developing nations

**Abstract**
  
  Sustainable development has quickly become one of the most important goals for every single unit of the world economy to consider, be it industries, small manufacturers, governments, countries, everyone. It is today an established fact that the environment is eroding and that human capitalistic needs are the cause of it. But a capitalistic economy is also the path that is believed to bring equality among people by eliminating social class, eliminate poverty and provide equal opportunities to everyone. When this is the case, sustainable development is our mechanism to take care of our planet and environment while ensuring that there is continual societal progress of bringing equality and access to opportunity to everyone and pulling people out of poverty.

	Under the Paris Agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) there are higher or more ambitious targets for developing countries than for developed countries in regards to Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), the reason being that developed countries risk their economic viability (jobs loss) in making the quick transition, whereas developed country have the opportunity to set up industries within sustainable tenets as they grow.
  
	The primary research question is to quantitatively establish the fact that the cost of sustainable development is higher, and hence less probable, for developing countries than it is for developed countries. To establish this I wish to use consumer products packaging as an industry/example to compare costs between a developed and a developing country, draw a causal graph (like a bayesian network) and establish the elements that drive/affect the sustainable development of consumer packaging goods, find the most causal element of the network and use it to establish the cost to SDG and then compare it among a developed and a developing country.

**Research Methodology**

  Instrument variable (IV) approach is a very effective Causal Inference technique, variables called instruments are used to determine an exogenous part of the variability from the endogenous predictor. In other words, this approach allows the use of only that part of the variation in the predictor that is “arguably random” i.e., is not related with unobservable factors affecting both predictor and outcome. This approach allows researchers to effectively estimate the causal relationship between the outcome and the predictor.
In this study,  use the IV approach along with stratification to group countries into groups of close properties. I plan to use all economic indicators captured in the world bank (World Bank, 2019) reports between the years 2010-2019. But given the diverse and widely spread out nature countries even after clustering them into Developed and Developing, regressing them will not be an effective technique, hence I plan to use additive regression trees so that we improve the explanatory power of our variable to see effective values from which inference can be drawn.

**Research Proposal**
  Using an Instrumental Variable, in my case the amount of packaging waste production, to establish that the SDG goals are a burden on a Developing country and contrast it with a Developed country. In this research, we will use exogenous variation in waste production as an  instrument variable to predict the economic performance of both developed and developing countries and compare them to establish the above research hypothesis	

1. Find data on how much waste is generated in two sets of countries- Developed and Developing countries.
2. Gain specificity/approximation as to how much of it is packaging waste.
3. See what share of it is made out of sustainable products.
4. Stratify countries bases on their Economic Status and the sustainable waste share.
5. As shown in the Causal DAG below, try to establish there are no unobserved confounders U1- May require a few regression outputs to establish this fact
6. Finally, use the Instrument Variable to regress the causal state Y~X + Z
7. Do this for all/both of the strata, depending on how it is stratified.
8. Compare them in tables and graphs. Interpret the results and draft conclusions 

The reason for choosing this study design is to argue if this research is needed ot not,  the first reasoning is that how else can it be established that developing countries, when they focus on ambitious SDG targets, let other crucial elements of a rapidly growing country i.e education, social housing, healthcare for all and jobs creation which are essential to lifting people out of poverty, slip away back to poor status, which made these countries be a developing nation in the first place.
